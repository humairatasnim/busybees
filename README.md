# üêù BusyBees: Kids' Chore Management App

## Overview

**BusyBees** is a chore management app designed to make assigning and tracking chores a breeze for parents and fun for kids! With gamified rewards, progress tracking, and an intuitive interface, BusyBees turns household responsibilities into a family collaboration adventure.

### Problem Space

Managing household chores can be challenging for parents, especially with young children. Traditional paper chore charts or manual tracking methods can lead to missed tasks and inconsistent tracking. Kids often lack incentives to engage in chores consistently, leading to friction and unmet responsibilities. BusyBees addresses this by creating a structured, gamified system that makes chore completion transparent, rewarding, and fun.

### User Profile

- **Primary Users**: Parents or guardians of children, who are introducing structured chore routines and want to offer rewards for task completion.
- **Secondary Users**: Children will use the app to view and track their assigned chores, earn points, and redeem rewards.

### Features
